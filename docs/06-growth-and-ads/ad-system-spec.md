# Ad System Specification

Resolver input is university, page type, slot, consent state, authenticated context and device class. Resolver returns ordered eligible units from active immutable `ad_config_versions`, after global/network kill switches, public/private layer switches, auth exclusion, isolation mode, frequency cap, placement enablement and consent requirements. Cache config at edge with documented maximum 60-second TTL; kill state has separate short TTL and client rechecks on next page load. Emergency direct SQL procedure is in runbook.

Formats: banner, native, social bar, in-page push, pop-under, smartlink, direct sponsor. Each registry record declares pop-style, consent requirement, injection mode, allowed pages and minimum dimensions. At most one pop-style unit per page; default one/user/24 hours using random first-party browser storage ID, no fingerprinting. Admin can turn off public or private aggressive formats independently. Login/auth page type is constrained in database to disabled and checked in code before importing ad bundle.

Every slot has reserved geometry; below-fold lazy loads; scripts async/deferred; isolated adapter/error boundary; failure leaves empty slot. Never overlay/adjacent to Book, Submit or Raise Objection. CLS budget ≤0.1. Add Playwright checks for auth script absence, slot/button spacing, no layout shift and kill switch. Direct sponsor creatives have visible Sponsored label, approved image/link, schedule, target pages/tenant, expiry and first-party bot-filtered impression/click counts. Never incentivize clicks.

Consent categories and regional defaults gate scripts. Privacy page renders network names from active `ad_networks`, avoiding drift. CSP Report-Only first, then enforced allowlists; Permissions-Policy, referrer policy and iframe sandbox apply. Adapter interface: `resolve(config, context)`, `mount(slot, consent)`, `destroy()`, `report(error)`; network-specific code stays behind adapter. New network requires data, adapter, setup checklist and QA signoff, never page edits.
